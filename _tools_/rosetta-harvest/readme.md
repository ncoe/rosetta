# Known Issues / Tasks
* Cannot harvest C++ because it redirects to itself
* The pie chart is missing the second chart, and the labels (is this possible to add?)
* Restore the rest of the pom
* Consider using a logging framework like slf4j
* Look for a git dependency for harvesting local data instead of system calls
